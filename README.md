# metroid-map
Map for classic NES game Metroid. Main goal is to make a tool to keep track of already visited sections in a game.

This project consists of two main modules:

* [Metroid Map](/app) - main application used to display the map
* [Metroid Map Analyzer](/analyzer) - tools to analyze and transform game screenshots into simplified map graphics
